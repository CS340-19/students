I am Spencer Howell, and I am a sophomore at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville majoring in computer science. I grew up in Murfreesboro, Tennessee before I moved here to Knoxville to begin college. I enjoy creating apps and websites in my free time, as well as going to concerts, going on hikes, lifting weights and running.
